# Computing Tutorial

This repo contains Jupyter Notebooks for students to introduce
themselves to both the Jupyter environment and scientific computing
concepts at the same time.

## Student Note

These notes are intended to introduce students
to numerical computing using Python and the Jupyter Notebook.
These materials do not assume any level of familiarity with computer
programming or numerical computing.

## Instructor Note

Many concepts are intentionally omitted to reduce the (already onerous)
level of incidental complexity students must navigate to learn this
material.  The goal is to expose students to the power and simplicity of
numerical computing and inspire further study.
