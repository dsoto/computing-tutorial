    "Here, each of these boxes is called a cell, and the contents of the cell are evaluated when you hold down the shift key and then hit the enter key.  \n",

    "Now, you won't find all the symbols that you find on a calculator on a computer keyboard so it won't always be clear how to enter mathematics.  Luckily, most programs are similar, and the internet is your friend to find references and examples."
